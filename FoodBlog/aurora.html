<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Cats</h1>
<p style="color: red; border:2px solid Violet;">The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, 
    is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated 
    species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have 
    shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 
    7500 BC.<br>It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat, but it also ranges 
    freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for 
    companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are 
    adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a
    strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision 
    and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary
     hunter and a crepuscular predator.</p>

        Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, 
        grunting, and body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in 
        frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes 
        and perceives pheromones. Cat intelligence is evident in its ability to adapt, 
        learn through observation, and solve problems.
        
        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate 
        zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging 
        from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at cat fancy events as 
        registered pedigreed cats. Population control includes spaying and 
        neutering, but pet abandonment has exploded the global feral cat population, which has 
        driven the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.</p></pre></h3>

        <p style="color: red; border: 2px solid violet;">
            The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, 
            is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated 
            species of the family Felidae. <span class="highlight">Advances</span> in archaeology and genetics 
            have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.
            It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat, but it also ranges freely as a feral cat, 
            avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. 
            Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a
            strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell 
            are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.

        <p style="background-color: tomato; text-align: center; padding: 10px;">
            Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, grunting, and body language. 
            It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. 
            It secretes and perceives pheromones. Cat intelligence is evident in its ability to adapt, 
            learn through observation, and solve problems.

    <p>Personality and Care Savannahs are known for their loyalty, often compared to dogs 
        in their devotion to their human families. They possess a high level of energy and 
        intelligence, requiring both physical exercise and mental stimulation to stay happy. 
        Interactive play sessions and challenging puzzles can keep a Savannah engaged.
        <br><br>
        Health and Well-being: As a relatively healthy breed, Savannahs still benefit from proactive health care, 
        including regular check-ups, vaccinations, and preventive measures against common feline ailments. 
        Their diet should be rich in high-quality proteins to mirror the nutritional intake of their wild ancestors.
        <br><br>
        Living with a Savannah: These cats love to climb and explore, making it essential to provide them with safe, accessible 
        high places within the home. They are also incredibly social and thrive on attention and interaction, 
        so integrating them into your daily activities is key to their well-being.
        <br><br>
        The Savannah's blend of wild looks and affectionate, loyal nature makes them a unique companion, 
        offering a glimpse into the wild from the comfort of your home. <br>Their care requires attention to 
        their physical and mental needs, ensuring they have ample space to explore and engage with their environment.
